    <h1>Product Health Check maturity</h1>
        <p>Descriptionâ€¦</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Notes & Errata</h1>
        <p>Ideally we're able to blend the needs of team members with the desires of the busienss in the same way we aim to provide for any product, meeting user needs and business goals.</p>
        <p>These aren't mutually exclusive, despite the declared intentions of late-stage capitalism, neo-liberalism, or share holder primacy.</p>
    <h2>Items to consider or incorporate</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Value Delivered</li>
            <li>Validated Learning</li>
            <li>Stats &amp; Data</li>
            <li>Items of Fun</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Drumbeat Template</h1>
        <p>The following is a template used and abused for years in the trenches of product teams. This is a collection of proven techniques to aid in answering many of the questions trad organizations might bring up around output and status, while simultaneously (and front-loading), a more outcome-oriented approach to presenting an update.</p>
        <p>This template content can and should be modified as your organization goes through transformation toward adopting the product model. <i>TLDR:</i> Update this template based on your team and organizational needs.</p>

    <h1>Week of MM/DD/YYYY</h1>
    <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>What did we do as a team through the week?  Mostly how the team interacted and key focus areas. Focus on what value was delivered more than a simple status detailing tasks that were done.</p>
        <p>Value delivered is value realized for our clients and their users. Good teams do agile things, great teams ship.</p>
        <p>Writing concise summaries is an extremely useful skill for designers to practice, especially if focused on value delivered and articulating design decisions through a business lens (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/what-jeff-bezos-learned-from-requiring-6-page-memos-at-amazon.html">see Jeff Bezos 6-pager memo example</a>)</p>
        <p>Also Note: Recommend saving this area for after highlights from the week are captured in the bullets below.</p>
    <h2>Wins</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This section is for key takeaways for the week that would qualify as valuable work that moves UX needles. More specifically look for insights gained, products updated or shipped, or stakeholder participation.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Why: A bullet or two of why these items matter can help frame the value of design work</li>
                    <li>Tactically, the list itself should be straightforward as a copy/paste exercise from the prior week</li>
                    <li>If new items were prioritized over the previous week, call this movement out in service of transparency</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Help us do a thing</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Key Outcomes for Next Week (Now)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Capture what is on the docket for the upcoming week/sprint</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looking ahead to the next week serves as a good reflection point</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <h2>Upcoming (Near &amp; Later)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar to an outcome-based roadmap, this is an unprioritized list of items on the horizon in the next 4-8 weeks</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's typically far too much ambiguity to map timelines beyond a quarter</li>
                    <li>This one area where traditional, timeline-based roadmaps fail and how a user-centered process can accommodate changes based on new insights and learning</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <h2>Other Items (TBD)</h2>
        <p>Links to additional supporting documents for ease of access and transparency</p>
    <h3>Terms &amp; Acronyms</h3>
        <p>Glossary terms that have been defined by the team as part of their ongoing, ubiquitous language defnitions can reside here. This could also be a simple link to a Wiki or other documentation source (aka non-developer accessible).</p>
    <h3>Backlog</h3>
        <p>Link to existing or past backlog locations. A red flag to look for here is multiple links. If business-side stakeholders are maintaining their own backlog, this is an issue. If the team's designer is managing their own backlog, this is an issue. </p>
    <h3>Assets</h3>
        <p>Links to prototypes, videos, audio, research reports, or similar items that support smooth delivery of the product.</p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>Anything that doesn't fit into the above categories could reside here. This is mostly a catch-all for anything we haven't yet thought of.</p>
