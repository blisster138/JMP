## Goals
- As a developer, I can can commit and push code to a remote repository
- As a user, I can read the vision about the tool.
- As a consultant or support staff member, I can get an automated drumbeat with weekly update of what progress we've made
- As a member of a software development team, I can access and download this tool as an open source project

# Drumbeat Retro
**Positives:**
- Getting back into some development & coding
- Connected the repo (including public SSH key)
- Went fishing

**Questions or Concerns:**
- Remote pairing etiquette for driver/navigator (it's easier co-located)

**Negatives:**
- No colocation
- Pop doesn't want to work with second display
